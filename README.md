## Project Detailing
### Details
Two applications were made until this point. They are:

#### Graphical Interface - Selenium Testing
Through Cucumber, TestCases were created, connected to Java backend. This code aims to access the Amazon webpage and perform a query. After finding the books with a certain criteria, it lists which one is the cheapest and opens the page. Finally, it validates if the title of the page opened really is the one that was the cheapest

#### Rest APIs - Testing
Two codes are actually built for this test. The first one is the software that is the testing-object. It provides Customers and Movies, in a way that each Movie is allocated to one Customer. This system provides REST APIs, returning each Customer by ID, as well as returning All Movies. Once started, the APIs will be available to be consumed in your localhost, sending a JSON with the results.

On the other hand, the second software is the Testing code, in Cucumber + Java. This code will consume the APIs exposed by the first system, on the steps. Then, with the result, it takes different parameters from the returning JSON, takes specific keys, and validates.
